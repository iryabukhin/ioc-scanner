        <short_description>W32.Locky.IOC</short_description>
        <description>Locky is a ransomware that encrypts files on the compromised computer and then prompts the user to
            purchase a password in order to decrypt them. The usual infection vector is a malicious macro laced
            Microsoft Office document received in an enticing email. Upon opening, the document entices users to enable
            macros to fix 'encoding' issues. If macros are enabled, a downloader is dropped and executed, leading to
            subsequent download and execution of locky. Locky then proceeds to encrypt files on disk matching a long
            list of extentions, including files on shared network drives, renaming them with a '.locky' extension. It
            also removes shadow copies to make recovery harder. Decryption instructions are placed on the desktop in
            several formats and set as the Desktop wallpaper. The instructions generally point to a darkweb site, which
            demand a ransom, usually in Bitcoins, in return for the private key and a decrypter program.
